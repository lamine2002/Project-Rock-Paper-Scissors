 # Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Description

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and then the computer randomly chooses its own selection. The winner is determined by the rules of the game, and the score is displayed on the screen. The game ends after 5 rounds, and the final winner is declared.
